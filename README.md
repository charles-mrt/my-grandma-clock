## ðŸ’» Project

My Grandma's Clock is a component that simulates a digital wall clock for people with difficulty memorizing in with the date of the month and day cycle, especially at dawn.
It is possible to add the username, change the colors and dynamically change between am/pm or day cycles such as morning, afternoon, night and dawn.

## ðŸ’»ðŸ”– Project's goal
I developed this app with the aim of facilitating my grandmother's routine so that she knows what the date is, the day of the week and the cycle of the day, as she suffers from a disease that causes forgetfulness.
In this case, we keep a smartphone connected 24 hours a day in the app and turned on like a wall clock.
